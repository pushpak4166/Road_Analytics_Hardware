# Road_Analytics_Hardware

###  1) Dateset collection: 
             MPU sensor was used with the help of arduino circuitry to collect readings of accelerometer and gyroscope. The readings were collected for different conditions of  roads.
             
### 2) Data preporcessing:
             Using some techniques of signals and systems data precessing was performed. Have a look at Precessing folder for more detail.
