#  1) Dateset collection: 
             MPU sensor is used with the help of arduino circuitry to collect readings of accelerometer and gyroscope. 
             The readings are collected for different conditions of roads.
             
# 2) Data preporcessing:
             Using some techniques of signals & systems data precessing is performed on the raw data.  
             Have a look at Precessing folder for more detail. 
          
# 3) Classification:
             Thresholding algorithm
             Neural Network model
             
# 4) Observation: 
             We observed that NN is performing better than Thresholing algorithm for categorizing the conditions of road.
                     
So the tflite model is created for analysing the road index.
